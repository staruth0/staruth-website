            Our mission is to empower individuals and businesses by providing
            the latest Apple products that seamlessly integrate into their
            digital lives. Saving the ocean and our planet will take more than
            what one person, company, or organization can do on their own, but
            only 3% of all philanthropy in the U.S. goes to environmental
            causes.
